## LocalDevelopment Setup

1. Add a `.env` file in the root of this project that looks like this:`DRP_CF_HTTP_PORT=3001`

2. Installdependencies`npminstall`

3. Start app `npmrundev` Note: This will fail on the first time, because the `build` folder is just build up. Rerun and you are fine!

4. Install Prettier for automatic code formatting!
